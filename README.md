![Project Preview](Untitled_Artwork.jpg)

## 📖 Overview
This project demonstrates how to create an automated email notification system using the **Google Workspace** ecosystem (Google Forms, Google Sheets, Google Docs, and Apps Script).

The system listens for new responses on a Google Form, processes the data, retrieves specific content from a Google Doc, and automatically sends a customized email to the respondent.

## 🚀 Features
- **Automated Triggers:** Sends an email immediately when a Google Form is submitted.
- **Dynamic Content:** Pulls email body text or attachments directly from a specific Google Doc.
- **Custom Logic:** Analyzes the form response to decide what content to send.
- **Zero Server Cost:** Runs entirely on Google Apps Script.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Google Apps Script** (JavaScript/TypeScript based)
- **Google Sheets** (Database)
- **Google Forms** (Input)
- **Google Docs** (Template Source)

## 📂 How to View the Code
To see the logic behind the automation, you need to look at the script attached to the Google Sheet.

1. Open the provided Google Sheet (or the file you downloaded).
2. On the top menu bar, click on **Extensions** (擴充功能).
3. Select **Apps Script**.
4. You will see the code editor where the automation logic resides.
